Command Line  - Reflections
How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? 
Command line is a way of interacting with a computer. A user will type commands into a Terminal window, asking the computer to complete tasks. Command line is different from GUI(Graphic User Interface), you do not use point and click. 
Command line can be used by opening a terminal and typing in commands on the native OS or using a downloaded application(Like Ubuntu). The customer can then do multiple tasks, for example navigate the folder structure, create/copy/move/remove files or folders and other tasks.

Can you think of an analogy for it?
To use an analogy or comparison. I would compare interacting with a computer with interacting with a trained dog. The trained dog is aware of the commands and is prepared to fulfill them. Outside of these command's the dog will look bewildered by commands it does not recognise. 

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
No, I was not aware of the structure of the week's sprint, and found myself looking at all the material and watching videos to get an understanding of what is required. 

Name five commands you used and what they do.Did you learn anything unexpected?
$ pwd - display the route of the folder you are currently in. This only displays up to the Ubuntu source folder - not the home folder on the computer itself.
$ grep -i "instruction" README.md - display in the file, where the "term" appears, -i  removes case sensitivity from search terms. - only shows the line or term itself. 
$ mkdir - Make a directory.  establish a directory.
$ rm -rf - Remove Folder. Specifically, Remove a directory. Additional instruction is required - rf
$ cd - move between folders. Move between the folders that are open to be navigated.  

Version Control with Git - Reflections
What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a technology that is used to manage source code of a project, git allows for distributed Version control between different developers on the same project. They can code on their own versions and then when suitable merge the code together.
Files and folders can be added and amended. Comments can be added and removed. Source code projects can be copied or branched off and worked on remotely. 

Github is a secure online platform that hosts source control code of a Project or Git. Github provides a central resource of the source code that is committed to it.    

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
A potential analogy of Git and Github would be video rental stores. Where the rental store is the GitHub, a central store for all the material for example DVD and Videos tapes rewound. The Git would be the individual DVD and taps that are taken home and played remotely.  
The only issue with this analogy, is that you can amend the project, you cannot amend the video material.

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
I believe so. However, the only way to reinforce the learning is regularly working with the code. 

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
I stuck to the time frame. I did do the Udacity Course on Version control separately - which took quite some time. 

Install and Explore Git - Reflections
What is a Git workflow?
Git Workflow is a technology and methodology of splitting up work between various parties to support their individual work, before adding this work to a main source control. This is supposed to ensure that code can be isolated, and set aside for development. Later when it has been completed and fully tested that it can be combined into the final production environment. 

What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I was fortunate that the group had shared a Graphic of the Workflow. This allowed me to visualize the workflow process, from Working Directory, Staging(Stash), Local Repository and Remote. Git status was a good command to understand where I was up to in the process. 
I also did the udacity course in addition to this course - ot went into different terms Git Log - SHA, Git Diff, Git reset/revert and others. 

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?
I followed the Udacity Course through to the end which was a great help. 

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
I went over the time box allowance and at times had to leave my computer to understand what I was learning and reflect.

Track and Commit - Reflections
How would you describe the stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
From my learning, it is not how or why the new feature or change has been made, but what change has been made. This puts in context the amendment at a later date. 
 
Branch, Pull, Merge
What is main?
Main is the main source code of your software development project, that would be pulled down from Github, with a local version on your desktop that you can work with remotely. This version would initially be stashed in a Git file. 

Why create a branch?
When you create a branch, you create an opportunity to work on the project to test new concepts and add and test new code. This is so we can develop code freely without the risk of damaging the previous work that has been done, and retain a level of version control.

Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
The technical language can be complex. However, with time and experience the concepts become easier to understand and why they are important. 

Ko-Wai-Koe - GitHub Fork & Clone - Reflections
I had spent quite some time on Ko-Wai-Koe activity - the links to the Devacademy-foundations were not working for these tasks. So I had to create my own repo: https://github.com/anthonymartin36/ko-wai-koe - and add it to github. This took some time, then I had to delete the whole project and restart as the Merge button would not appear. All the initial startup activities have been complete successfully. 

Github clone and fork was straight forward again the reflections link was not working. So I forked https://github.com/anthonymartin36/foundies instead and add this file to the main folder. 
The task itself was straightforward.
